* Concolic Testing
** Definition
   - It is a made up word - *Conc*rete + Symb*olic* = Concolic.
   - It is a path coverage based testing tool, which analyses source code,
     builds a path execution tree and then it can choose critical values and
     evaluate which paths are available, which are not and which are dead.
     - Thanks to that it can generate test cases much better than classic
       property based testing tools, because it is more direct. Still, property
       based testing has a lot of use cases e.g. generating test data and
       finding *black swans*.
   - In *Erlang* tool which does that is called *CutEr*.
     - There are other tools like `jCUTE`, `SAGE` etc.
