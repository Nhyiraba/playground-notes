* Test-Driven Development

** Observations

- Code coverage - you should not have 100% from 100% of your code.
  - Pareto rule is working in this case also.
  - 100% code coverage of your domain in enough.
- Prototypes are not the place where you should do a TDD.
  - You have to prepare MVP, check it, verify your thesis...
  - And delete whole code!
