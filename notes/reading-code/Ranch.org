  - What is a *acceptor pool*?
    - According to http://www.erlangpatterns.org/acceptor-pool.html it is an
      application facility pattern which is used to reduce the latency of
      inbound connections.
    - Given collection of workers, it is started with the listening mechanism,
      but after accepting data from it delegates processing of that to the
      actual worker.
