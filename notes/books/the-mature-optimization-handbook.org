* The Mature Optimization Handbook

** Premature optimization is a root of all evil

- This is an excerpt from longer statement, that programmers are often spending
  too much time on focusing on wrong things (Knuth said that 97% of time). But
  we have to focus and don't miss the opportunity to fix the critical 3%.
  - As usual - citing is hard! ;)

** Focus on right problems

- Well defined problem, avoid under specification (*too slow* is too generic)
  and false assumptions about place and importance of that piece.
- Avoid referring to walltime (you've got multiple clocks in your hardware and
  software).

** Flying by Instruments

- Software is complex, too complex to find out issues based on assumptions and
  your understanding without support from measurements.

** Wrong problem to fix
** Thinking in systems
** Visualization and Metrics
** Samples and Storage
** Tools and Measurement Errors
