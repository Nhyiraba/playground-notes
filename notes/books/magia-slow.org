** Details and Concretes

- Semantic ladder - at the top is the abstraction, at the bottom details and
  concretes. In the middle - office, daily language (boring!).
- You should move up and down really fast, try to back-up all abstract concepts
  with real, meaty examples.
  - Everyone need examples.
- Action and heroes matter. Names matter.
- You should describe things only when you want to focus on them, like in the
  movies.
  - Constantly moving from background (abstraction and almost no details) to
    foreground (a lot of details, focus, emphasis).

** Verbs

- Active verbs.
- Movement is life, it describes perfectly that something is vibrant, alive and
- Active voice, passive only when needed, when you can't use active or you want
  to emphasis drama or something else.
- Subject and predicate - queen and king in sentence.
  - Queen should be beautiful and eye-catching.
  - King should do things.
- Avoid modals (be sure, not conditional).
  - Verbs and simple statements have more power and are more direct than more
    convoluted statements, with passive voice and modals.
