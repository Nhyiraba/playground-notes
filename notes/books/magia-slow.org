* Magia Słów - Jak pisać teksty które porwą tłumy? (PL)

** Details and Concretes

- Semantic ladder - at the top is the abstraction, at the bottom details and
  concretes. In the middle - office, daily language (boring!).
- You should move up and down really fast, try to back-up all abstract concepts
  with real, meaty examples.
  - Everyone need examples.
- Action and heroes matter. Names matter.
- You should describe things only when you want to focus on them, like in the
  movies.
  - Constantly moving from background (abstraction and almost no details) to
    foreground (a lot of details, focus, emphasis).

** Verbs

- Active verbs.
- Movement is life, it describes perfectly that something is vibrant, alive and
- Active voice, passive only when needed, when you can't use active or you want
  to emphasis drama or something else.
- Subject and predicate - queen and king in sentence.
  - Queen should be beautiful and eye-catching.
  - King should do things.
- Avoid modals (be sure, not conditional).
  - Verbs and simple statements have more power and are more direct than more
    convoluted statements, with passive voice and modals.

** Lesson - Ian Flemming

- Dynamic verbs.
- Describing real and familiar feeling.
- Luxury and description of it.
- Unexpected events should be unexpected.
- Manly talk needs details (dimensions, exact numbers, detailed description
  without too many adjectives and small amount of adverbs - only for emphasis).
- James Bond always did things - he didn't *think*, *could*, *would*, always *do*.
  - Modals are for pussies!

  details.

** Long sentences

- Split long and boring sentences into smaller, but sometimes you need to
  connect too short sentences into bigger one.
- Repetition in longer sentences can be a key thing, to emphasis certain things.
- Enumerate in order to build up the sentence properly.
- Summary can remind reader about what we talked there.

** Story and Plot

- Golden Trinity (*Omne trinum perfectum*, Tacit).
  - Introduction, explication and ending.
- Building plot incrementally is good, but sometimes hurry can help in
  explication and building tension before the most important situation in the
  story.
- Sometimes additional details are less important than one, well-thought and
  precise detail about your hero.
- Twist have to be well-thought and matching the main drive of whole story.
- Each hero need anti-hero.
  - e.g. Harry Potter and Lord Voldemort.
- Try to build sympathy of the reader to your hero,
- Sometimes you need to answer questions which may appear in your's reader mind.
  - Sometimes the more important is answer on "how?" than "what?" and "why?".
- Grimm's brothers fairy tales.
  - No explicit moral.
  - Good story, good personas.
  - The more you hate bad people, the more you love good ones.

** Showing, not describing

- Don't be exact.
  - Do not describe what your hero is doing, describe situation around, use
    environmental and behavioral details which are not referring directly.
  - Try to point your reader into a proper thought.
- Don't describe the feelings.
- Make an action instead of thinking.
- Let the people think and analyze on their own.
- People are not fools, let them think and dream.
- Instead of thinking and baffling around state, add a "friend" to your hero.
  Together they will act more nicely and it will be more interesting than
  internalized thoughts and 3rd person narration.

** Emotions

- Not only irony, happiness are good for readers. Sadness, truth and other
  feelings are as important as the fun parts.
- By introducing a story you will involve people - they will dare for more,
  because they will feel the bond.
- Great ads and tag-lines are referring to emotions, that's the only way to
  create a bound with other people.
- Also often novels are giving people a way to do something that they are afraid
  or just cannot do. That's why adventure books, or romances are really popular.
