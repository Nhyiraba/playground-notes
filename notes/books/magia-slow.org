** Details and Concretes

- Semantic ladder - at the top is the abstraction, at the bottom details and
  concretes. In the middle - office, daily language (boring!).
- You should move up and down really fast, try to back-up all abstract concepts
  with real, meaty examples.
  - Everyone need examples.
- Action and heroes matter. Names matter.
- You should describe things only when you want to focus on them, like in the
  movies.
  - Constantly moving from background (abstraction and almost no details) to
    foreground (a lot of details, focus, emphasis).
